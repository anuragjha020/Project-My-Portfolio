                <h1>Hi, I'm Anurag Jha, a Web Developer</h1>
                <p>Hello! I'm Anurag Jha, a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in various technologies and frameworks. My journey into web development started with a fascination for creating interactive and user-friendly interfaces. Over the
                    years, I have honed my skills in several key areas:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript:</strong> These form the backbone of my front-end development toolkit. I excel in crafting responsive and visually appealing web pages using the latest standards and best practices.</li>

                    <li><strong>React.js:</strong> I have extensive experience in building single-page applications (SPAs) and dynamic user interfaces with React.js. I enjoy leveraging its component-based architecture to create modular and scalable solutions.</li>

                    <li><strong>Core Java & Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs):</strong> My proficiency in Core Java and OOPs concepts allows me to develop robust back-end logic and applications. I'm adept at applying design patterns and principles to ensure
                        code maintainability and scalability.</li>

                    <li><strong>Spring Framework (Spring Boot, JDBC):</strong> I have practical experience in developing enterprise-level applications using the Spring framework. I'm skilled in Spring Boot for rapid application development and JDBC for database
                        connectivity.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>SQL:</strong> I am proficient in writing SQL queries and managing relational databases. I ensure data integrity and efficient retrieval by optimizing database schemas and queries.</li>

                    <li><strong>Version Control (Git & GitHub):</strong> I utilize Git for version control and collaboration, with GitHub as my preferred platform for hosting repositories and contributing to open-source projects.</li>

                </ul>

                <p>I am constantly learning and adapting to new technologies and methodologies in the ever-evolving landscape of web development. My goal is to create intuitive and efficient solutions that enhance user experience and meet business objectives.</p>

                <p>I have created these modern and responsive web applications.</p>
